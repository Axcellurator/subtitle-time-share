###Animelo Summer Live 2016 歌曲粗轴项目

2016年度的 Animelo Summer Live 再度召开。为了扩充本共享计划的曲库容量，以及为后续可能存在的字幕工作打好前站，现在开始着重进行 ASL 2016歌曲粗轴项目。

本项目将会为本年度 ASL 的一百多首歌曲制作基于 CD 的粗轴。歌曲来源为歌手发布过的 CD，日文歌词来源为 Kasi-time。

#共享字幕时间轴

作为制作特效字幕的准备工作，制作歌曲的时间轴，尤其是 K 轴，十分消耗人力和时间。现在虽然可以从 KRC 歌词转换得到歌曲的 K 轴，但是精确度不能令人满意。人工打轴还是有必要的。

为了减少重复劳动，在此共享我所做过的歌曲的时间轴和 K 轴，归于公有领域（Public Domain）。

时间轴有些是针对动画插入歌，有些是针对完整歌曲，请自行分辨。

希望各位也能共享自己做的时间轴和 K 轴。请注意，其将归于公有领域（Public Domain）。

##Projects Running now
###Project of Rough Timing for Animelo Summer Live 2016
Animelo Summer Live (ASL) 2016 has just been hold. In order to enlarge the song pool of this program, and get prepared for possible following projects, we are now concentrating on the Project of Rough Timing for ASL 2016.

For over 100 songs played in ASL of this year, this project will create roughly timed subtitles, which are based on their CD. Songs are from CDs released by the artists, and Japanese lyrics are from the site Kasi-time.

#Sharing of Timed Subtitles
As basic works for creating karaoke effects, however, timing, especially timing karaoke, can usually be a dull task which requires much time and spirit. Although we can turn KRC files* into timed karaoke subtitles now, considering its low accuracy, it can still not take the place of the ones made by Aegisub. 

In order to avoid the repeated and meaningless works, I decided to share all of subtitles timed by me, and devote them into Public Domain. 

You should know that some of the subtitles are created for songs inserted in anime and others are for the Full Ver. of a single song, which you have to tell of.

I hope you can also share your works. And I must declare that all the subtitles in this program will be devoted into Public Domain.
